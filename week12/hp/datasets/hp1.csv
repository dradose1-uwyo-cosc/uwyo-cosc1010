"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","And the boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid is bringing him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Rubeus Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Rubeus Hagrid","No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","The only family he has."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Good luck...Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Up. Get up.  Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Happy birthday, son."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Yes, Aunt Petunia."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Yes, Uncle Vernon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Aren’t they wonderful, darling?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","How many are there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","I don't care how big they are!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Make it move."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","MOVE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","He's asleep!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","He's boring."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Snake","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Anytime."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Man","SNAKE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mum, mummy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mum, help! Help me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","It's all right. It's all right."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Ow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","What happened?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","There's no such thing as magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Will I have to wear that, too?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","What, you? Go to Smeltings?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Yours? Who'd be writing to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","No more mail through this letterbox."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Shoo! Go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Because there's no post on Sunday?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Go away, ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","What is it? Please tell me what's happening!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Give me that! Give me that letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Get off! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","They're my letters! Let go of me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Make a wish, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","Who's there? Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Sorry 'bout that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley Dursley","I-I-I'm not Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","I-I am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Thank you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Excuse me, who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Sorry, no."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Learned what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","You're a wizard, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","I-I'm a what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia Dursley","Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia Dursley","We had to tell him something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","It's an outrage! It's a scandal!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","He'll not be going!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Muggle?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley Dursley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","But you like a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","If you know where to go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Man","Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Witch","Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirinus Quirrell","Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Oh, nice to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirinus Quirrell","F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Goodbye."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","See, Harry, you're famous!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Boy","It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","Very well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 713."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","What's in there, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Stand back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","I still need...a wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Rubeus Hagrid","A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Hello? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Sorry, but what's curious?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","And...who owned that wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Rubeus Hagrid","Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Maybe if you wrote it down?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Shh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","What happened to...to You-Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Rubeus Hagrid","What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Harry Potter","Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Man","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Harry Potter","Excuse me, excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Guard","Right on your left, ma'am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Harry Potter","Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Guard","9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Molly Weasley","It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Harry Potter","Muggles?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Molly Weasley","Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Molly Weasley","Fred, you next."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","George Weasley","He's not Fred, I am!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Fred Weasley","Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Molly Weasley","Oh, I'm sorry, George."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Fred Weasley","I'm only joking. I am Fred."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Harry Potter","Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Molly Weasley","How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 9¾","Ginny Weasley","Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","No, not at all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Scar...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Oh"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Woman","Anything off the trolley, dears?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","No, thanks, I'm all set."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","We'll take the lot!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","I got Dumbledore!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I got about 6 of him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Hey, he's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Ahem. Sun-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I'm...Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Hey, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Whoaa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Neville Longbottom","Trevor!  Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Draco Malfoy","It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","We're ready for you now. Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione Granger","It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Albus Dumbledore","I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione Granger","Oh, no. Okay, relax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","Mental that one, I'm telling you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Draco Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","SLYTHERIN!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Susan Bones."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","Harry, what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Ronald Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Fred Weasley","We got Potter! We got Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","George Weasley","We got Potter! We got Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Minerva McGonagall","Your attention, please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Albus Dumbledore","Let the feast...begin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Seamus Finnigan","I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","What's he teach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Bloody Baron","Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Look, it’s the Bloody Baron!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Hermione Granger","Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Like this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Boy","Ravenclaws, follow me. This way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Neville Longbottom","Seamus, that picture's moving!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Look at that one, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","I think she fancies you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Man in a painting","Welcome to Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","The Fat Lady","Password?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","That was bloody brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Minerva McGonagall","Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","We got lost."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Minerva McGonagall","Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus Finnigan","Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Ah. Mail's here!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Can I borrow this?  Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus Finnigan","Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Hermione Granger","I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Neville Longbottom","The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Good afternoon, class."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Good afternoon, Madam Hooch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","With feeling!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","Up. Up. Up. Up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Oh..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Neville, what are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Students","Neville...Neville..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","We're not supposed to take off, yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Down! Down! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Help!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Come back down this instant!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom-!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Is he alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Owowowow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Give it here, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Is that so?  Have it your way, then!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","Good job, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy 2","Oh, that was wicked, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Harry Potter?  Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","An iguana s-such as this is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","You wait here."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","... an essential in-gredient."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Nearly Headless Nick","Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","A century, according to McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred Weasley","Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George Weasley","Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred Weasley","Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George Weasley","But they'll turn up in a month or two!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","I-I didn't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Who doesn't?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","The staircases change, remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Let's go this way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Before the staircase moves again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","It's Filch's cat!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Quick! Let’s hide though that door!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","It's locked!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","That's it, we're done for!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Alohomora?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Argus Filch","Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Filch is gone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Probably thinks this door's locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","It was locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","And for good reason."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","All","AHHHHHHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Guarding something?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","She needs to sort out her priorities!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think so. What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I like this ball."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","What do I do with it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","Whoa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","All","The swish and flick."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Draco Malfoy","Wingardium Levio-saaa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","Wingardrium Leviosar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Hermione Granger","Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."

"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Seamus Finnigan","Wingard Levosa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Well done, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Whooaaa! Ooh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think she heard you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Neville Longbottom","Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirinus Quirrell","TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Albus Dumbledore","SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Girl","Hufflepuff, this way!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Boy","Stay together!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Percy Weasley","Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","How could a troll get in?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Hermione! She doesn't know!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","I think the troll's left the dungeon!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Hermione, move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Help! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Hey, pea brain!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Ahhh! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Ew."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Whoa, whoa whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Anything! Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Swish and flick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Is it...dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Well, what it is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Well, what it is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirinus Quirrell","Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe...."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Good for you to get us out of trouble like that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","What are friends for?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","I'm not hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Severus Snape","Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","That explains the blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Blood?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","But why would anyone go near that dog?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","So you're saying..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","But I-I never get mail."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Let's open it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","It's a broomstick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","But who...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","Scared, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Rolanda Hooch","Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Yes!  Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Rubeus Hagrid","Well done!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Seamus Finnigan","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Another 10 points to Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Gryffindors","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Marcus Flint","Give me that!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Marcus Flint","Take that side!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Harry Potter","Whoa! Whooa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","What's going on with Harry's broomstick?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Jinxing the broom? What do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Leave it to me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Come on, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Lacarnum Inflamarae."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Man","Fire! You're on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Severus Snape","What? Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Go go go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Looks like he's gonna be sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Lee Jordan","He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rolanda Hooch","Gryffindor win!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Draco Malfoy","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Whoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Crowd","Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","That thing has a name?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Exactly."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ghosts","Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Knight to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Queen to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","That's totally barbaric!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","See you haven't."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","We've looked a hundred times."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","I think we've had a bad influence on her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","I-I've got presents?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","There they are."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","It's some kind of cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Well, let's see then, put it on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","My body's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","I'm invisible?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","There was no name. It just said use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Harry Potter","Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Argus Filch","Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirinus Quirrell","Severus...I-I thought..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Severus Snape","You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirinus Quirrell","W-what do you m-mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Severus Snape","You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Argus Filch","Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Mum?  Dad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","I only see me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","How can it? Both my parents are dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","George Weasley","Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","We go and visit Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Albus Dumbledore","Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Albus Dumbledore","Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hi, Hedwig."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I'm ready! Ask me any question."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","...I forgot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Copy off you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Leg-Locker Curse?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","How? I can barely stand at all!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus Finnigan","I'll do the counter-curse!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus Finnigan","I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I found him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Follow me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","This is light?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Immortal?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","It means you'll never die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I know what it means!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Shh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","We think Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","That? It's a ... its um..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Is that...a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Norbert?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I don't understand. Is that bad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","It's bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Good evening."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","50?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Draco Malfoy","Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione Granger","Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Right. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","Hagrid, what's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","Okay. Then I get Fang!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","What is it, Fang?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","HELP!!!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","But what was that thing you saved me from?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","But who would choose such a life?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Can you think of no one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","The Philosopher's Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione Granger","You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry Potter","But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron Weasley","But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry Potter","I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron Weasley","And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione Granger","Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","My scar. It keeps burning."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","It's happened before."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Not like this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Perhaps you should see the nurse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","And did he seem interested in Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","How do you know ?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Someone's going to try and steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","And with Dumbledore gone"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Severus Snape","Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Uh...we were just..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Severus Snape","You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Now what do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We go down the trapdoor. Tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Trevor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Neville Longbottom","Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Now, Neville, listen. We were"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Neville Longbottom","No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Let's go.  Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","It's for your own good, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Ow! You stood on my foot!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Alohomora."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Uh. It's got horrible breath!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We have to move its paw."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","What?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","The harp. It stopped playing."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ew! Yuck! Ugh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Jump! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Hermione!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Hermione!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Now what are we gonna do?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Just relax!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Hermione! Where are you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Do what I say. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahh! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","He's not relaxing, is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Apparently not."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help! Help me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","We've got to do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Ron, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I don't know. Sounds like wings."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Curious. I've never seen birds like these."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What's this all about?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I don't know. Strange."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What's wrong, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","It's too simple."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","This complicates things a bit!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Catch the key!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","I don't like this. I don't like this at all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Harry Potter","Where are we? A graveyard."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Harry Potter","There's the door."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","Now what do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","What happens now?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","Wait a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","No, Ron! No!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","He's going to sacrifice himself!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Check."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","Not as good as you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","You?  No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Snape was trying to save me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Then-then you let the troll in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Use the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","He lies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Tell the truth! What do you see?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Let me speak to him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Master, you are not strong enough."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","I have strength enough for this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Harry Potter, we meet again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry Potter","Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry Potter","You liar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Quirinus Quirrell","Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Fool! Get the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Fine. They're both just fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","But, what happened to the Stone?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","All right there, Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Ron Weasley","All right? You?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","All right. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Hermione Granger","Never better."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Albus Dumbledore","Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Hermione Granger","We're tied with Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Albus Dumbledore","And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Seamus Finnigan","Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Lee Jordan","Yeah! We won!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Hermione Granger","Come on, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","One minute."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","Thanks, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
