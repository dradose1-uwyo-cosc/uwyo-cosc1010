"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","Now you've done it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","He's in there. Vernon…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Dudley Dursley","Who'd want to be friends with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","…in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Dudley Dursley","I'll be waiting to open the door!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Excellent! …And you…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Why don't you sit down?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","You can't have met many decent wizards then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Stop, Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Bad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, shh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Baaad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, please stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Your family?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","What terrible things? Who's plotting them?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Ooo… er… can't… say… argh..."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Ok– I- understand. You can't- say."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Don't make me talk, I— Errr…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Bad Dobby."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","So when they arrive at the ninth hole…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Let me go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Get in there, and keep quiet!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","What the devil are you doing up here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","I- I was just—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Yes, sir… See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Well, I expect they've… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Give me those, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","No! Ahh! Ooh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, get back here!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, please, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","I can't. Hogwarts is my home!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","…it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that's just the top of it!”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Vernon Dursley","You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Harry Potter","Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Ron Weasley","Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Ron Weasley","You'd better stand back. Let's go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Petunia Dursley","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Vernon Dursley","Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Dudley Dursley","Dad! What's going on?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","George Weasley","Go, go, go, go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Dudley Dursley","Dad, hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Ron Weasley","Come on."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Dudley Dursley","Dad!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Vernon Dursley","Oh… Damn."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Yeah, Mum would never know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","It's not much, but it's home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","I think it's brilliant"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ginny Weasley","Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Yes dear. It was on the cat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Hello. W-what did I do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Morning, Weasleys."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Morning Arthur!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","What a night. Nine raids. Nine!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Raids?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Well now. Aah! And who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Did you really? How'd it go? Did you—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Arthur!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, umm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Percy Weasley","Errol…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","He's always doing that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Percy Weasley","Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Oh, no."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Ron Weasley","But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Floo powder?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Ron Weasley","Diagon Alley!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","'Diaganilly.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","What did he say, dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Arthur Weasley","'Diaganilly.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","I thought he did."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Other","Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Witch","Not lost are you, my dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Other","Come with us. We'll help you find your way back."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","No! Please!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Harry! Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Oh, it's so good to see you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Well, it's great to see you, too!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I definitely need to remember that one."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Ok! Bye!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Thank you. Bye."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Come on! Everyone's been so worried."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Other","Harry… Harry Potter…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Other","Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Ah! Here he is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Ron Weasley","Mum fancies him."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Photographer","Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Gilderoy Lockhart","It can't be- Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Photographer","Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Gilderoy Lockhart","Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Ginny Weasley","Leave him alone."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Harry Potter","Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Hermione Granger","Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","Lucius."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","See you at school."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","10:58! Come on! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","The train will be leaving any moment!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","Fred, George, Percy you first!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","After you, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Whao!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Station guard","Oy! What do you two think you're doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","I don't know. The gateway's sealed its self for some reason."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Maybe we should just go and wait by the car."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","The car…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Uh, right. Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Now all we need to do is catch up with the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","We can't be far behind."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Do you hear that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","We must be gettin' close."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Hold on…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Wha-aahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I think we found the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Welcome home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Up! Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","It's not working! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Aahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Be thankful it's not your neck."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Whomping Willow","Argg!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Aaaahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Aaaahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Come on! Go! Fast!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Scabbers, you OK? The car! …Dad's gonna kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Harry Potter","See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Argus Filch","Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Albus Dumbledore","…They are not."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Harry Potter","Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Albus Dumbledore","I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","We'll go and get our stuff, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Minerva McGonagall","What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Minerva McGonagall","Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","All","Good morning, Professor Sprout!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Hermione Granger","Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","All","Aah! Ooh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Neville Longbottom","Uhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Seamus Finnigan","No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Other","There's Nearly-Headless-Nick!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Neville Longbottom","Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Howler","RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint?"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Marcus Flint","Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","Uh-oh. I smell trouble."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","“I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.” You've got a new Seeker. Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Malfoy?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","That's right. And that's not all that new this year."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Marcus Flint","A gift from Draco's father."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Ah! Oh… Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","He called me a Mudblood."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","He did not!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","What's a Mudblood?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","That's horrible!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","It's disgusting."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","And it's codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here… Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute… eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Not really."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Basilisk","Come, come, come to me. Come to me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","That voice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Voice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Didn't you hear it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Spooky."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Writing on the wall","Basilisk","Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Did you hear it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Hear what?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","That voice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Voice? What voice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Basilisk","It's time."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","It's moving. I think it's going to kill."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Kill?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","I don't like spiders… What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.' It's written in blood."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Oh, no… It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Students","Ahhh! What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Draco Malfoy","'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you…Mrs. Norris? You've…murdered my cat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","No. No."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","I'll kill ya… I'll kill ya!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Other","Ravenclaws, follow me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Gilderoy Lockhart","Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","Rubbish!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Severus Snape","If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Gilderoy Lockhart","I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Severus Snape","Yes, Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Strange?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just… strange."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Are you mad?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Man in a painting","She's right, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Ahem. Vera verto!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Students","Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about…the Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Three guesses who."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Muggle-borns."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Harry Potter","Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","If you're talking about Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Harry Potter","Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","Well, how long will it take to make?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","A month."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","I know. But it's the only plan we've got."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Students","Yeah! Come on Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Lee Jordan","Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Marcus Flint","Yeah! Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","All right there, Scarhead?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Oliver Wood","Watch yourself, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","Wood! Look out!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Rubeus Hagrid","Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","I'll stop it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","Training for the ballet, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","You'll never catch me, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Lee Jordan","Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Finite incantatem!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Hermione Granger","Are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, not you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this… won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Students","Oh! Ooh! Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Other","Ohh! Uhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","…you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Rubeus Hagrid","Broken? There's no bones left!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Students","Uh-huh-ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Much more flexible, though."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Draco Malfoy","Uhh, uhhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Hermione Granger","You will be able to, won't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Uh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Basilisk","Kill. Kill… Time to kill!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Hello!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Indeed. Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","You nearly got Ron and me expelled!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Uhuh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Uh-huh-huh… Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Why do you wear that thing Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Put him here. What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","There's been another attack."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","What can this mean, Albus?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","It means…that our students are in great danger."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","What should I tell the staff."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Heh… No. No one ever comes in here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who's Moaning Myrtle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Moaning Myrtle","I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh…aaaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","She's a little sensitive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Whoaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Do you think he's all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who cares?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Good luck, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","Thank you, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Wands at the ready."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Draco Malfoy","Scared, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","You wish."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Draco Malfoy","Everte statium!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Vincent Crabbe","Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","Rictusempra!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Gilderoy Lockhart","I said disarm only!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Draco Malfoy","Serpensortia!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Severus Snape","Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Gilderoy Lockhart","Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Severus Snape","Vipera evenesca."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Justin Finch-Fletchley","What are you playing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I'm a what?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","You can talk to snakes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","Oh, that's what you said to it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","You were there! You heard me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","But I'm not… I can't be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Students",""
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I'll see you back in the common room."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Basilisk","Blood…I want blood…They all must die. Kill… Kill… Kill! Time to kill."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Argus Filch","Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","Professor… I swear I didn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","This is out of my hands, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","Professor Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","You're wrong."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Umm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course you don't, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","You don't think it was me, Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","No, sir. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Very well, then. Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Crabbe and Goyle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","How?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Whose hair are you ripping out then?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode– Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Ahem…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ron, maybe I should do it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Yeah. Right."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Wingardium leviosa. Here they come."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Vincent Crabbe","It's good right? Ah… Cool!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Vincent Crabbe","Ummm…um."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Gregory Goyle","Ummm…um."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","How thick could you get?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Come on. Let's get 'em."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves… Add the hairs."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Ugh- essence of Crabbe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Cheers!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","I think I'm gonna be sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Me too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ughh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Uh… Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Uh… Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Excellent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","But where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Hermione, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Just go. You're wasting time!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","I think the Slytherin common room's this way."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","Excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","What are you doing d- uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Uhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","I'm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","Ah- um… Reading."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Reading?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","Uh-huh."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Ahem…Stomachache."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","You're wrong!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","But then you must have some idea who's behind it all."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very…odd."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","It's his… stomachache. Calm down."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","S- scar."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hair!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","Hey! Where are you going?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","That was close!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Hermione Granger","Go away!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Ahh! Wait till you see. It's awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hermione? A- are you OK?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Hermione Granger","Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Hee, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","Look at your tail!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Ha, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","Have you spoken to Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","Yuck!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh– huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","Why would I throw something at you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Don't ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","'My name is Harry Potter.'"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","'Can you tell me?'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Diary","No. But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Tom Riddle","Harry Potter","Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","Riddle! Come."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Professor Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Harry Potter","Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","Is there something you wish to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","No, sir. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","Very well, then. Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Good night, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","Let's get yeh out of there."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","You can't! You don't understand."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","No!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Harry Potter","Hagrid! Haagriid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Harry Potter","Woah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","That'll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","No!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Neville Longbottom","Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Ron Weasley","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Ron Weasley","But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Who's there? Hello? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","What's that for?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Hagrid, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","I'm fine! I'm alright."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Did you hear about Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","What you had to understand about that is—  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Of course! Come in! Come in."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Ron Weasley","That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Already here, Fudge? Good…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","You think so?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Come, Hagrid… Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Good boy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Ron Weasley","Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","What?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be “follow the butterflies?”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Shush!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Can we go back now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Don't panic."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Hagrid? Is that you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Then you're not the monster."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","But have you seen it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Ahh- hhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Well, thank you. We'll just…go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Aragog","Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Can we panic now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Know any spells?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Where's Hermione when you need her?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Whoah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Whoah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Arania exumai!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Thanks for that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Go on! Go! Get us in the air."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","The flying gear's jammed!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Come on! Pull!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","I'm trying!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Hermione's answered that, too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","Pipes? It's using the plumbing!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Severus Snape","A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","My m-moment?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Severus Snape","Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Poppy Pomfrey","Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","Ginny Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","What about my sister?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Books can be misleading!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You wrote them!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Is there anything you can do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah…I'm ah…going to have to do the same to you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Don't even think about it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","To ask you how you died."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Who was it Myrtle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh…But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… I died."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Just like that? How?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Hesha- Hassah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah… There's no need for me to stay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Oh, yes there is! You first."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Now, boys what good will it do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Better you than us."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","All right. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Uh…thanks Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","This way."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","It looks like a… snake."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","It's a snakeskin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","I'm fine!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Uhh… Hello. Who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Um…Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Really? Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","What'll do I do now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","OK."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","Hesha- Hassah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","She won't wake."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","She's still alive, but only just."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Are you a ghost?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It won't come until it's called."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Give me my wand, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","You won't be needing it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","But why?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","But, why did you want to meet me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Harry Potter","Ginny-"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Tom Riddle","Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Harry Potter","Ginny…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Ginny Weasley","Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Harry Potter","Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Gilderoy Lockhart","Amazing! This is just like magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Thanks, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","It's just… You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Not intentionally, but yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Because I asked it to."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Godric Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Um-humm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Ridiculous!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","How dare you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","I beg your pardon?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","And? Who was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Ah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","I see."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Don't worry. I will be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Ahh! Oow!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Mine? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Open it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Master has given Dobby a sock!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","What? I didn't give."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","You've lost me my servant!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","You shall not harm Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Advada."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Just promise me something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Anything, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Never try to save my life again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Nearly Headless Nick","Thank you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Good evening, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Nearly Headless Nick","Good evening!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Ron Weasley","Uhh-um… Welcome back, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Harry Potter","Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Albus Dumbledore","Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","Oh, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Rubeus Hagrid","Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Harry Potter","Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Students","Yeah! Yeah!"
