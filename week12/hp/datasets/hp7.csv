"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Rufus Scrimgeour","These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Hermione.  Your tea is ready, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Coming, Mum."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Don't you look lovely.  All packed?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mr. Granger","Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Quite sure, dear.  See the big bold letters that say 'Sugar Free'?  Dead giveaway."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mr. Granger","Mm.  Yes. Hello, kitten.  Don't you look lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Obliviate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Goodbye."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Ron Weasley","What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Arthur Weasley","Close the door."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Arthur Weasley","These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they're not alone..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Ron Weasley","C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Severus.  I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  Come.  I've saved you a seat."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","My lord?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Are you burdened?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Narcissa Malfoy","My lord is always welcome here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","You bring news I trust, Severus?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","And this information comes --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","-- from the source we discussed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Corban Yaxley","I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Death Eater","Well, they've got that right, then, 'aven't they?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Pius, what say you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Pius Thicknesse","One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Bellatrix Lestrange","My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Peter Pettigrew","Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","I require your wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Do I detect elm?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","Yes, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","And the core?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","Dragon -- dragon heartstring."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","No, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Charity Burbage","Severus, please.  We're friends..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Avada Kedavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Nagini... Dinner."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Time for the teary farewell."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Do you have any?  Magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","What a cruel thing to ask."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Well, this is goodbye then, boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","I don't understand.  Isn't he coming with us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Absolutely not."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Come on, Dudley, we're off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","I don't think you're a waste of space."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Well... thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","See you, Big D."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Good riddance."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Rubeus Hagrid","All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Kingsley Shacklebolt","You're more important."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Bill Weasley","Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Wasn't always this handsome."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Dead ugly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Bill Weasley","True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fleur Delacour","You are still beautiful to me, William."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Remus Lupin","Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Nymphadora Tonks","My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","All right, all right!  You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","The Trace?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","The real one...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","I believe you're familiar with this particular brew."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","No!  Absolutely not!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Hermione Granger","I told you he'd take it well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Ron Weasley","Never done that before, have we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Well, none of us really fancy it, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Mundungus Fletcher","Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Blimey, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Straight in here, if you please."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Just trying to defuse the tension."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Wow -- we're identical!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Wow -- we're identical!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Not yet you aren't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Yes, don't fancy this color at all."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fleur Delacour","Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Ron Weasley","I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Hermione Granger","Harry, your eyesight really is awful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Blimey.  I almost forgot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","You'll ride with Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Rubeus Hagrid","Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Alastor Moody","Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Can't do it, 'arry.  My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Dragon fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Death Eater","That's him!  The real one!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Hol' tight, 'arry!  We've got ter get yeh out of here!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","Hagrid... HAGRID...!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Voldemort","Avada..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Is no one back yet?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","They were on us from the star', Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","Well, thank goodness you two are all right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Oh my God!  George!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","The house!  Quickly!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Remus!  What're you doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Are you mad...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","What Creature!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","A grindylow!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Who did this to him?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Someone else is back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Kingsley Shacklebolt","The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Kingsley Shacklebolt","What gave you away?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Hey ya -- Well... thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Nymphadora Tonks","Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Hermione Granger","Really?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Always the tone of surprise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","Are we the last?  Where's George?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","Remus.  Where's my son?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","How do you feel, Georgie?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Saint-like."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","Come again?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Bill Weasley","Mad-Eye's dead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Bill Weasley","Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Wha'?  One of us?  Tha's mad.  I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.  An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Wha's so funny!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","'Ear, 'ear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Better."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemont","Then explain this!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","But it makes no sense..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemort","Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemont","I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Going somewhere?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","No one else is going to die.  Not for me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Come with me.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Wedding?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Do you think he knows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Won't he know he's being hunted?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","All together now!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","One.  Two.  Three!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Were you going to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","I see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Zip me up, will you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","George Weasley","Morning."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","How's it look on your end, boys?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Fred Weasley","Brilliant!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","George Weasley","Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","And this would be...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Don't be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","What's this all about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","No idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Come now, you don't expect me to believe..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","That's it then?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard's property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Excuse me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","The sword is missing. I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I'm not your enemy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","Where is your guard, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","I came alone.  I don't really need them anymore..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","We want you to be the godfather."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","Say yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Hello, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Xenophilius Lovegood","Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Nice to meet you, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Xenophilius Lovegood","I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Sir?  May I sit down?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Mr. Potter!  By all means!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","The occasional owl.  Though it was strange..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Strange, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Woman","Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.  I read your obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure.  Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.  You and I both know who that is, Elphias."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Who are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out. Bathilda Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.  Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Oh, right.  Slipped my mind..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone.  She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two.  I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","For years now.  That's where she first met Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Of course.  The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.  It was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Patronus","The Ministry has fallen.  The Minister of Magic is dead.  They are coming..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Hermione Granger","Ron!  Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","Harry!  Go!  Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Where are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","This way!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We need to change."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","How the ruddy --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Undetectable Extension Charm."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're amazing, you are."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Always the tone of surprise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","That'll be the books."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What she said."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Same."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Woman","Wicked scar."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","You're joking."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Down!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Petrificus Totalus! Go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","She doesn't argue."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Lock the door, get the lights."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're the boss. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're the best with spells."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Obliviate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","How is it they knew we were there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Maybe you still have the Trace on you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Right.  Perspective."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","I have an idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Alastor Moody","Severus Snape?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Mad-Eye...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What was that about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Homenum revelio."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","It's a spell to reveal human presence."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We're alone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Lily Potter","Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Lily Potter","James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry!  Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Ron!  I've found him!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Did she now?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Hey!  I think you two better come down here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Stop!  I order you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Ron Weasley","Kreacher..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Been spying on us, have you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Maybe he knows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Ever seen this before?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","That was Master Regulus' locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Where's the other one?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","But was it here?  Did you ever see it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Blood-traitor Weasley --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Ron!  RON!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Answer her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","How do you mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Find him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Pius Thicknesse","As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this:  You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Cormac McLaggen","My father will hear about this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Neville Longbottom","He's not here, you fools."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","They have flesh memories."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","You mean... it remembers me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Harry Potter!  So long it's been --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Kreacher","As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","I'm no thief, you foul little git. I'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","You're a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Master Weasley!  So good to see you again!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","Wicked trainers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Listen, I panicked that night, all right?  I never volunteered to die for you, mate.  Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","Stop lying!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Harry Potter","When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Why?  Was it valuable?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","You've still got it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Wouldn't be difficult, would it? Bleedin' gave it away, din' I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.  Says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've, too, she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Harry Potter","Who was she?  This witch?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Well, she's right there, in't she? Bleedin' bow an' all."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","It gets really tricky."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Correct."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","This is completely mental."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Completely, utterly, without question."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I'm nobody."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You're somebody.  Be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Morning, Reg!  Good luck today."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Oh... yeah.  Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Apparently so."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","That's bloody disgusting."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Are those...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Muggles.  In their rightful place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You appear to be quite popular."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","The Ministry must be hiring young these days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","I didn't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","Cattlemole!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","It's still raining in my office. Two days now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Downstairs...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron.  You don't have a wife."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Look, we'll go with you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Woman","Level Two.  Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","This is you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","I don't like him being on his own down there."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You really have horrible teeth, you know that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, did he?  Good.  We'll go straight down."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Percy Weasley","Oh, yes... of course."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Witch","Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Pius Thicknesse","Sh...careful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Runcorn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Accio locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","All right, all right.  Let's calm down, shall we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms.  I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","R-Runcorn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","M-morning."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron, it's me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Hello, Reg.  Isn't Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wakanda","Let me guess.  It's raining in Yaxley's office again?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Tell him to try an umbrella."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Is that a threat, Runcorn?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Bloody cold down here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Man","I'm half-blood, I tell you!  My father was a wizard!  Look him up! William Alderton!  He worked here for thirty years..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","It's here..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Reg..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?  Wife to Reginald?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this that wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","But I didn't take it.  I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven.  It chose me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole.  Wands only choose witches.  And you are not a witch."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell them what I am!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","What the devil are you doing, Albert?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Expecto PATRONUM!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Relashio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","You?  It's you! Reg, it's Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Harry Potter...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Mary!  Do as I say!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","I'm sorry.  It's just --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Long story.  Nice meeting you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Piss off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","Seal the exits!  Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Quickly!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Accio Dittany."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Unstopper it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Hermione.  His arm --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Just do it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Don't be stupid."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It's all I feel safe doing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","What're you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Repello Muggletum... Muffliato..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","They're great."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Make sure to leave some for Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","No problem."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How bad is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","So where do we go next?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","No, don't!  Don't say it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How d'you know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Dinner?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Tea?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Is that it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","... alive."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I hate it.  It's like he's here with us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","That's why we're going to kill it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Dissendium!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Incendio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Expulso!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","It's angry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","What're you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I can put it in my bag --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","Who was he?  The thief?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Mykew Gregorovitch","Just a boy!  Not of the village. It was he who took it.  I never saw it again.  I swear on my life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","I believe you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I thought it had stopped."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Tell me. What you saw."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","He's found him.  Vol--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","The wandmaker?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Yes.  How'd you know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Don't -- It... comforts him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","And what gets you through the day?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How long before he can travel?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You're not doing enough."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Take it off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Take it off.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Better?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Loads."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We'll take turns.  Okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Scabior","What's that?  That... smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Harry Potter","Snatchers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Harry Potter","Good to know your enchantments work."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Hermione Granger","He could smell it.  My perfume."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","We have to leave.  We're not safe here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Then we'll go by foot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","I'm hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","We're all hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Leave it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Mum can make food appear out of thin air."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Oh, speak English, can't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","I said leave it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Good plan."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","My turn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","None of us do."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Wizards were here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I don't like this place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I want to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I'll tell you in a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Maybe you could tell me now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","O-kay."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","It only takes in that which makes it stronger..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Exactly!  Which means..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","... it can destroy Horcruxes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","There's only one problem..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","The sword was stolen."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","What's the problem?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Ron..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I thought you knew what you signed up for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, I thought I did too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Harry, we weren't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Stop!  Stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Go then.  But leave that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","And you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Are you staying?  Or coming?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","What?  Ron, no -- please --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","He's gone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","It's a Muggle station."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","'I open at the close?'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","What do you reckon it means?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","What d'you mean -- wearing it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Hermione..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Don't ever let me give you a haircut again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Yeah. I think they would."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Is it -- ?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","No.  But look."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Did you know he had a sister?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Happy Christmas, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Someone's watching us.  By the gate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","C'mon."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","I don't think this is a good idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","We look like ordinary Muggles."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Relax.  This is right.  I know it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Omigod.  Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry, I'm not sure about this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She's gaga, remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Here.  Let me do that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","His name.  Can you tell me his name?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She wants us to go upstairs."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","All right..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She wants me to go.  Alone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's all right.  You stay here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Bathilda Bagshot","You are Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Bathilda Bagshot","I have something for you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Good.  That's good..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","We got away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","You've outdone yourself this time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Where are they?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","For a time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Get to the hard part, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Wizard rule over Muggles."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","And Dumbledore believed in it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione.  Where's my wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Maybe we can --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","No..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Lumos! Accio Sword."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Diffindo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Hermione..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Are -- you -- mental?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It was you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","And the doe.  That was you as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No.  I reckoned it was you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","My Patronus is a stag."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Right.  Antlers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","You didn't see anyone else?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Anything?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","And we did, didn't we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","All the more reason."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No.  I can't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Stab it, Ron.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Voldemort","I have seen your heart and it is mine..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Don't listen to it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  Don't listen to it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  Stab it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","We were better without you, happier without you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Saving your life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","That too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","And just think of it.  Only three to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Everything all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Fine.  Actually... more than fine."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Hey."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Wo -- hey -- ouch!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Um... I don't know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Harry Potter, you give me my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","How come he's got your wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Never mind why he's got my wand --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","You destroyed it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It's a long story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Don't think this changes anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","See me doing what things?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","What happened out there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It's a long story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Exactly how did you find us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","With this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","It?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","A voice."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","And what may I ask did I say?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Knew what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","It was true.  Every word."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Yeah..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Engorgio."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Wo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Reducio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","What's going on in there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","We need to talk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","All right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Jesus.  It was there too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","But what does it mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Not still mad at him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","I'm always mad at him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Keep off the dirigible plums."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","What is it? Who are you? What do you want --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Well, sir, we need some help."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","What's going on here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Do you see that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","No!  Don't go near it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Yeah, all right..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Where is Luna, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Luna?  Oh, um, she'll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","You mean this?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","What is it?  Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you're all familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers?'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","It's in here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Sorry... I still don't really understand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Elder Wand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Resurrection Stone..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","... then encloses both in a TRIANGLE. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","It's obvious, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","The Wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","The Cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","The Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Why the Stone, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","There have always been Cloaks --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","You forgot the water."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","The water?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","For the tea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Did, didn't I?  How silly of me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","No, you mustn't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","You're my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it's really you they want..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Who took her, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Nooooooooo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Stop!  I've got him --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","I'll do the enchantments."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Scabior","Hello, beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Voldemort","If not you, then who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Voldemort","Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","They exist.  The Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","What're you saying?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Don't touch her!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Stop it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","What happened to you, ugly?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","What's your name?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","Dudely.  Vernon Dudley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Check the list.  And you, ginger?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Stan Shunpike."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Weasley... Barney Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Snatcher","There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Fenrir Greyback","Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","What did you put on me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","A Stinging Jinx."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","How long will it last?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Not long."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Show me. Get Draco. Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Draco Malfoy","I can't be sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Lucius Malfoy","Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Scabior","Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Lucius Malfoy","You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Draco Malfoy","What's wrong with his face?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Yes, what is wrong with his face?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Snatcher","He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Snatcher","It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now. Are you mad? Go! Get out!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Luna Lovegood","Ron? Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Harry Potter","Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Hermione Granger","I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","I don't believe it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","We have to do something."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Garrick Ollivander","There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Hermione Granger","Please! please!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Shut up!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Luna Lovegood","You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Harry Potter","Help us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","Let her go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Peter Pettigrew","Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Dobby? What are you doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Of course, sir. I'm an elf."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Works for me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Luna Lovegood","Whenever you're ready, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Peter Pettigrew","Ow."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Who gets his wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","There is no place safer than Gringotts."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Like hell."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Expellliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Stupefy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Stupid elf. You could've killed me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Dobby","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Dobby","Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Luna Lovegood","We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic."
