"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Peter Pettigrew","Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I will not disappoint you my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door."

"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Cedric Diggory","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter."

"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Shall we? We don't want to be late."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","That isn't just any old manky boot mate."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","It's a portkey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Time to go. Ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","What's a 'portkey'?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","After 3. One... Two..."

"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Let! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","See ya later Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Home sweet home."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","I love magic."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Ron Weasley","Blimey Dad, how far up are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Lucius Malfoy","Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Draco Malfoy","Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Lucius Malfoy","Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Arthur Weasley","Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Fred Weasley","It's the Irish!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Here come the Bulgarians!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Fred Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Ron Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Announcer","Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ginny Weasley","Think you're in love Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","George Weasley","Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","George Weasley","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","Sounds like the irish have got their pride on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Stop! That's my son."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Which of you conjured this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","You can't possibly.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Crime?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Barty, they're just kids."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","What crime?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","Harry it's his mark."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","There was a man. Before. There."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","All of you, this way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Harry, who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","I dunno. I didn't see his face."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything from the trolley dears?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","On second thought, just the drewbals."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","It's alright I'll get it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Just the drewbals, thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Cho Chang","Two pumpkin pasties please."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Cho Chang","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything sweet for you dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Oh no thank you I'm not hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Rubeus Hagrid","Clear the runway."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Harry Potter","Well there's something you don't see every day."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Student","Blimey, that's one big woman."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Igor Karkaroff","Albus!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Igor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Olympe Maxime","Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Olympe Maxime","But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Filius Flitwick","You idiot!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Fred Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Hermione Granger","Alastor Moody? The aura."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","My dear old friend, thanks for coming."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Alastor Moody","That stupid roof."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Seamus Finnigan","What's that he's drinking do you suppose?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Harry Potter","I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Bartemius Crouch","After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","George Weasley","That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Silence!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Goblet of Fire","Albus Dumbledore","The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Alastor Moody."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Three sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","And they are so named?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Seamus Finnigan","Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","So, which curse shall we see first?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Yes..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Give us a curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Hello. What a little beauty."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Don't worry. Completely harmless."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","But if she bites... she's lethal!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","What are you laughing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Neville Longbottom","There's the um... The cruciatus curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Neville?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Son. You alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Harry Potter","Yeah well rather you than me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Cooked it up just this morning."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","It's not going to work."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Oh yeah? And why's that Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","So?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","That's why it's so brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","Ready Fred?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Ready George?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","You said.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry Potter. Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Rubeus Hagrid","No... No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Hermione Granger","Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Student","He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","No sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","No sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","You're absolutely sure?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Olympe Maxime","Well of course he is lying."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Alastor Moody","The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Igor Karkaroff","You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Alastor Moody","It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Bartemius Crouch","The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","What do you suggest Minerva?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","You heard Barty the rules are clear."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Severus Snape","Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Alastor Moody","I can do that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","How did you do it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","Let you know what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","You know bloody well what."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Piss off."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","What a charismatic quartet. Hello!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","This is cosy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","It's a broomcupboard."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Oh, no."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","I'm fourteen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","I dunno I haven't really thought about it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Fourteen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","No I didn't enter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry.  Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S...."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","The bird bites."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Sirius?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Sirius?! How..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","I dunno."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","You didn't hear a name?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","What are you saying?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","I'm not ready for this Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","You don't have a choice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Someone's coming!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Keep your friends close Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","Who you talking to?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Who says I was talking to anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","I heard voices."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Amazing. Amazing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Neville! You're doing it again!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Oh, right sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Is that right? Well.... what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Uhhh..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Well you can tell Ronald..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","I'm NOT an owl!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Bonsoir Olympe."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Couldn't forget you Olympe."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll be glad you came. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Ahh, c'est magnifique!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Can we get closer?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Ron was here?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Student","Cedric rules!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Student","Like the badge?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Excuse me.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Can I have a word?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Alright."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Don't worry about it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","You're a right foul git you know that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","You think so?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","I know so."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","Anything else?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Yeah. Stay away from me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","Fine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Draco Malfoy","Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Moody what are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Teaching."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Is that a student?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Technically it's a ferret."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Draco Malfoy","My father will hear about this!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Is that a threat!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","He might've mentioned it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Well you will do well to remember it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Better than fair the way I heard it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","But I'm not allowed a broom."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","You're allowed a wand."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Pssst! Harry? Is that you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Battle a dragon."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Rita Skeeter","Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Viktor Krum","You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Rita Skeeter","No matter. We've got what we wanted."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","What are you doing here Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Barty. The bag."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The welsh green. Mr Krum..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The chinese fireball. Oooooh."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The swedish short-snout. Which leaves..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","The horntail..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","What's that boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Your wand harry! Your wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","George Weasley","We knew you wouldn't die Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Lose a leg."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","George Weasley","Or an arm."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Pack it in altogether."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Seamus Finnigan","Go on Harry, what's the clue?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","What the bloody hell was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Caught on have you. Took you long enough."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","At least I warned you about the dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Hagrid warned me about the dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Boys."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Nigel Wolpert","Parcel for you Mr Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Thank you Nigel."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Not now Nigel. Later. Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Ginny these must be for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ginny Weasley","I'm not wearing that it's ghastly."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","What are you on about?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Dress robes? for what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Fred Weasley","Try saying that five times faster."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Ron Weasley","Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now, place your right hand on my waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Ron Weasley","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","My waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now bend your arm. Mr Filch..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","One two three, one two three, one two three."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Harry Potter","Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Fred Weasley","Never."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","George Weasley","Never."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Everybody come together."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Boys, on your feet."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","I think I'd take the dragon right now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Rubeus Hagrid","I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Rubeus Hagrid","And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Well, us and Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","But then again he can take himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Now I'm really depressed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Well Hermione, you're a girl."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","Oh well spotted."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Agreed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Cho!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Ok thanks. Cho?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Sorry? I didn't catch that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Harry I really am sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What happened to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Student","He just asked Fleur Delacour out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What did she say?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","No of course."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","She said yes??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Don't be silly."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Student","Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What did you do then?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Parvati Patil","Hi Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Padma Patil","Hi Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Hey!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","What are those??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","My dress robes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Well I expect yours are more traditional."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Leave it alone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Hello boys. Don't you look..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","... dashing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Ready professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","She looks beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Yeah she does."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Padma Patil","Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No. Absolutely not."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Harry. Take my waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","What's got your wand in a knot?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Padma Patil","Are you going to ask me to dance or not?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","He's using you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Doubt it. He's way too old."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","What? What? That's what you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Yeah that is what I think."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","You know the solution then don't you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Well that's completely off the point. Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","They get scary when they get older."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Ron you spoil everything!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Voldermort","Let me see it again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Voldemort","Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Neville Longbottom","You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","What's that supposed to mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Hey Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","How are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Spectacular."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","I must be out of my mind."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","I'd try putting it in the water if I were you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Myrtle!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Long time no see."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Well go on, open it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Merpeople","Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Harry, tell me again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Come seek us where our voices sound."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","The black lake, that's obvious."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","An hour long you'll have to look."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Why don't you help Potter put his books back."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Neville Longbottom","You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Neville Longbottom","I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","You're sure about this Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Absolutely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","For an hour."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Most likely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Most likely?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","You're telling me this now? You must be joking."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","I just wanted to help."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","You seem a little tense Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Do I?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Alastor Moody","Put that in your mouth."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","You may begin at the start of the cannon."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Seamus Finnigan","What's the matter with him?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Dean Thomas","I don't know I can't see him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","But she's my friend too!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Merpeople","Only one."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Bartemius Crouch","Get him another towel."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","I want all the judges over here now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fleur Delacour","You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fleur Delacour","Thank you! And you... . You helped!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Well... yeah... a bit"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Merci."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Hermione"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","I finished last Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Next to last."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fred Weasley","All that moral fibre eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","George Weasley","Well done 'moral fibre'."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Bartemius Crouch","Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Alastor Moody","Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Alastor Moody","And they say I'm mad."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Rubeus Hagrid","So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Ron Weasley","We're still misfits."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Rubeus Hagrid","Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Harry Potter","Mr Crouch?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","Then for once show them some."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","What did you say? What did you say to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Alastor Moody","Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","Harry! Harry how good to see you again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","I can come back later Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","Agh!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I do sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","What do you wish to present?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Mr Rosier is dead."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Alastor Moody","Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I didn't know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","If that is all the witness has to offer..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Silence!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","The name..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","The name! Give me the wretched name!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Barty Crouch! ... Junior."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch Junior","Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","You are no son of mine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Have there been other dreams like this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Cast them away."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Igor Karkaroff","It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Bubble juice sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","I haven't stolen anything."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Alastor Moody","Champions! Prepare yourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","On the count of three... ONE..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Fleur? Fleur!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Get down!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","No stop! He's bewitched Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Get off me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","He's bewitched!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","For a moment so did I."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Some game huh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Some game."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Go. Take it, you saved me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Together, on three. One, two, three!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","You ok?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Yeah, you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","Where are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","I've been here before."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","What are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Get back to the cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","Who are you? What do you want?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Kill the spare."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Cedric!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Do it, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Bones of the father, unwillingly given."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Blood of the enemy forcibly taken."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","The dark lord shall rise again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","My wand Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Hold out your arm."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Master. Thank you master."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","The other arm Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Not even you, Lucius."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Lucius Malfoy","My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Lucius Malfoy","I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Peter Pettigrew","I returned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Peter Pettigrew","Thank you master, thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Oh, such a handsome boy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Harry Potter","Don't touch him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","That's better. And now..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Harry Potter","Have it your way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","James Potter","Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Cedric Diggory","Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Lily Potter","Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Voldemort","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","Tell me what happened!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Harry Potter","He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Cornelius Fudge","Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Amos Diggory","Let me through! That's my son! My boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Are you alright Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Does it hurt?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Not so much now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","I'd better take a look at it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","What was it like? What was he like?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Severus..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Do you know who I am?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Albus Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Is he in this room? Is he in this room?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Harry get away from there!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Are you alright Alastor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","I'm sorry Albus."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","That's Moody, but then who's...?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Severus Snape","Polyjuice potion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","We'll get you up in a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Barty Crouch Junior."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I'll show you mine if you show me yours."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Your arm Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I'll be welcomed back like a hero."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Viktor Krum","Write to me. Promise."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Bye."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Fleur Delacour","Au revoir Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Ron Weasley","Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","No I don't think so."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Everything's going to change now isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Ron Weasley","Well I won't. You know I won't!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Harry will won't you?"
